# tGui_v3
tGui_v3 is reconstructed by TGUIv2. Some ideas of Qt (message and slot mechanism) have been added in the middle part, which has been used for reference by some Qt source codes. It is more convenient than before, and it is more convenient to maintain and implement(Baidu translation).
tGui_v3 是由TGUIv2重构而来的，中间加入了Qt的一些思想（消息与槽机制），借鉴了一些Qt的源码，比之前结构更加简单，维护和实现都更加方便。
